## Task bar device

### Functionality
This little widget tells me in how much time the next bus/tram/metro at the stop of your choice. If I go by foot, you can be told about the weather forecast for the near future.

I live or work somewher in Nancy and would like to know when I should leave without having to interrupt my workflow or connect to some website/application.

### Setup
I tell which transportation I want to take at which stops (also giving the information).

I can chose either the time of arrival or the time left to be shown.

I can also ask for weather information to be displayed. This way, if I walk, I know if I should stay in, should a shower be expected soon.

### Being informed through the task bar
A small widget in the task bar show the time (left) of passage. Also, if asked, the rain probability and amount should be shown for the next hour or so.

### Receiving notifications
